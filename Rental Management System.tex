\chapter*{Introduction}

It is safe to say that most activities such as apartment allocation carried out in most cities are done manually. therefore, there is a lot of strain on the individual running the apartment management system.The software will also manage most activities that take place in the apartment with the help of the apartment administrator. The goal is to design a software which is user friendly and compatible with the existing manual system and that will solve the problem of apartment management thus helping to reduce problems related to manual apartments.
